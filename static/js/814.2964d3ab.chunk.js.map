We view CSR as an integral part of our publishing process, emphasizing our commitment to being responsible corporate citizens. Our approach aims to contribute positively to the social and economic development of both the publishing and research communities.\n                <br/><br/>\n                One of the key challenges of implementing CSR in the educational sector is the disconnect between corporate initiatives and the needs of educational and skill development institutions. While corporations focus primarily on achieving their own objectives, educational institutions often have different priorities. This misalignment can lead to inefficient use of resources and time, ultimately impacting the quality of outcomes.\n                <br/><br/>\n                At Prime Sphere Publication, we strive to bridge this gap by fostering better collaboration and alignment, ensuring that our CSR efforts drive meaningful and sustainable progress in education and research.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\nexport default CorpSocialResp;"],"names":["CorpSocialResp","_jsxs","className","children","_jsx"],"sourceRoot":""}
